To-Do List App

Description: A web application that allows users to maintain a list of tasks they need to accomplish. It provides a way to organize and prioritize tasks.

Features:

Add tasks to the list.
Delete tasks from the list.
Mark tasks as completed (with a strike-through).
Filter tasks based on their status: All, Active, and Completed.
Store tasks in local storage to persist them across browser sessions.
Bonus Feature:

Option to set deadlines for tasks, with a color-coded system for nearing deadlines.

Here's what you can expect to learn:

HTML and CSS Basics:

Designing a user-friendly interface using form elements, buttons, and lists.
Styling with CSS to improve the visual appearance, including hover effects, strike-through effects for completed tasks, and possibly animations or transitions.
JavaScript Fundamentals:

DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation to dynamically add, delete, and modify tasks on the page.
Handling user events like button clicks (to add or delete tasks) or input changes (to filter tasks).
Using conditionals to check the status of tasks (completed or not) and applying styles or filters accordingly.
Data Persistence with Local Storage:

Learning to use the localStorage API to save, retrieve, and delete data. This ensures that the user's tasks are available even after the browser is closed and reopened.
Understanding the difference between persistent storage (like local storage) and session storage.
Working with Dates:

If implementing the bonus feature, you'll learn to work with JavaScript's Date object to manage and compare dates. This helps in setting deadlines and comparing them with the current date to apply color-coded alerts.
Conditional Styling:

Depending on the task's status or nearing deadlines, you'll implement logic to change the task's appearance (e.g., changing colors as a deadline approaches).
State Management:

Keeping track of the application's state, such as which tasks are active, which are completed, and which are displayed based on filters.
Code Organization:

As the app grows in complexity (especially with added features), you'll learn the importance of organizing your code. This might involve splitting code into functions, modules, or even using design patterns like the Module pattern.
Debugging Skills:

During development, you'll inevitably run into bugs or unexpected behaviors. This will teach you how to use browser developer tools, console logs, and other debugging techniques to troubleshoot and fix issues.
Responsive Design (Optional):

If you decide to make the app responsive, you'll learn techniques to ensure the app looks and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
UX and Usability:

A To-Do List App is a user-centric application. You'll learn about user experience (UX) principles, like providing feedback when a task is added, ensuring the interface is intuitive, and making interactions smooth.
In summary, a To-Do List App, though seemingly simple, provides a comprehensive learning experience, touching on multiple aspects of frontend web development. It's an excellent project for beginners to get hands-on experience and gain confidence in their skills.
